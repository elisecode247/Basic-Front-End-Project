# Free Code Camp Front End Project Starter
---
## Overview
A project starter for Free Code Camp front end projects. Try practicing in a different environment (instead of CodePen). Here's a [video](https://youtu.be/B8DvAis_jaQ) demonstrating all the steps below.

## Prerequisites
Install the following:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (Node has npm)
* A code editor or IDE (examples: Atom, Brackets, Sublime)

## Getting Started
1. Click the green button "Clone or download" and click "Download Zip"
2. Extract the zip file to where you want it on your computer
3. Open up the Terminal* and ```cd``` into the folder
4. In the Terminal, enter: ```npm install```.
5. In the Terminal, enter: ```npm start```.
6. Open up your code editor and begin coding. Every time you save your file, your browser refreshes, just like CodePen.

*For Windows users, it's called "Command Prompt".

## Submitting Your Project to Free Code Camp
Free Code Camp wants the url to your project. You can copy and paste into CodePen.

1. From the index.html file, copy everything inside ```<body> </body>``` excluding all the ```<script> </script>``` code and paste in CodePen's HTML editor.
2. From the styles.css file, copy everything and paste in CodePen's CSS editor.
3. From the scripts.js file, copy everything and paste in CodePen's JavaScript editor.
4. Click on the settings button next to the HTML editor to open up the Pen Settings.
5. Click "Insert the most common viewport meta tag"
6. Click on "JavaScript" in the Pen Settings. Next to "Quick-add", choose "jQuery."*
7. *Repeat step 6 except choose "Bootstrap".
8. Check to make sure everything is working, then submit to Free Code Camp.

*jQuery has to be first because Boostrap.js uses jQuery.
